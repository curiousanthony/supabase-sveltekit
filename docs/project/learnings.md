One-line insights discovered during development. Reviewed by team-architect every 10 entries.

- 2026-04-21 T-20: When extending a polymorphic-FK RLS predicate (one row scoped via either of two parent tables), use **AND across `IS NULL OR EXISTS(parent in my workspace)`**, never `OR` between two `EXISTS`. The OR form lets a member of workspace A insert/update a row whose A-side FK is theirs but whose B-side FK points at a victim's parent — only one branch needs to pass and the row becomes visible/writable to workspace B via the deal-side SELECT branch (stored content + phishing surface). The AND form requires every set FK to resolve to the caller's workspace, fails closed on legacy/buggy cross-tenant rows, and pairs naturally with a CHECK that at least one FK is set. Always also add explicit `WITH CHECK` to UPDATE policies — relying on PG's USING fall-through has historically been a foot-gun for pivot attacks.
- 2026-04-10 T-8: Replace workspace storage objects only after a successful new upload + DB update; validate object keys against `workspaceId/` before `remove()`; use Sharp `limitInputPixels` against decompression DoS
- 2026-04-10 T-39: Match an existing route’s Kanban (`flex` + `overflow-x-auto`, `min-w`/`max-w` columns) instead of inventing a new grid breakpoint pattern
- 2026-04-09 T-1: French PDF amounts need Intl currency + replace U+202F/U+00A0 so Helvetica does not garble thousands separators
- 2026-04-09 T-2: Centralize PDF_TIMEZONE in shared for every template date/time helper
- 2026-04-09 T-3: `default` + `assertNever` on DocumentType switch catches missing cases at compile time
- 2026-04-09 T-4: Typed wrapper for pdfmake CJS singleton avoids `any` on createRequire
- 2026-04-09 T-5: Certificat attendance — innerJoin seances on formationId avoids loading all contact émargements
- 2026-04-09 T-32: Hand-written SQL migrations can get out of sync with Supabase tracking — always verify schema_migrations table before `migration up`
- 2026-04-09 T-33: When hiding a filter category (e.g. remplace), reset active filter to 'all' if it matches the hidden category to avoid empty-list confusion
- 2026-04-09 T-10: replaceState from $app/navigation cannot be called before router initialization — guard with onMount + requestAnimationFrame on pages that read URL params in $effect
- 2026-04-09 T-9: Multi-step DB mutations (replace old + link new doc) must be wrapped in db.transaction() and use optimistic concurrency (WHERE status = expected) to prevent races
- 2026-04-08 T-S1: Locale-aware number formatting needed for French currency (not just toFixed)
- 2026-04-08 T-S2: pdfmake CJS via createRequire works but needs setFonts() before createPdf()
- 2026-04-10 T-34: logAuditEvent must accept a tx client and propagate errors when called transactionally — fire-and-forget is only safe for non-critical callers
- 2026-04-10 T-6: RLS via EXISTS subquery joining child→parent→workspaces_users is the standard pattern for tables without direct workspace_id
- 2026-04-10 T-7: Storage policies use (storage.foldername(name))[1]::uuid to extract entity ID from path convention {entityId}/filename.ext
- 2026-04-10 T-28: When raw-HTML email path exists alongside template-based path, remove raw HTML — all Postmark sends should use templates for consistency and deliverability
- 2026-04-10 T-37: transitionStatus already sets timestamp fields via STATUS_TIMESTAMP_FIELD map — no need to manually set sentAt when transitioning to envoye
- 2026-04-10 T-35: When linking quest sub-actions to document lifecycle, use sub-action orderIndex (not title matching) to identify specific actions within a quest
- 2026-04-10 T-36: Compliance warnings belong in the layout load (not per-page) so both Documents and Suivi share the same computed warnings from a single lightweight query
- 2026-04-13 T-12: Pre-validate lifecycle transitions before generating a replacement doc — generateDocument creates storage + DB rows that become orphans if replaceDocument rejects afterward
- 2026-04-13 T-11: Svelte 5 {#snippet} avoids template duplication when the same card layout is rendered in flat, grouped, and nested contexts — define once, @render everywhere
- 2026-04-13 T-17: Vercel Cron Jobs are the natural fit for SvelteKit-on-Vercel scheduled tasks — configure in vercel.json crons array, auth via CRON_SECRET bearer token, and use service-role Supabase client (not user session) since cron runs without auth context
- 2026-04-20 T-13: Server-side preflight must run on every generation entry point (e.g. Documents actions and Suivi quest generation); skipping one path is a compliance gap even if the UI looks complete.
- 2026-04-20 T-14: For batch async work that may partial-fail, share one `batchId` across every audit-log entry (success and failure) so post-hoc replay/grouping is trivial — and pass the `tx`/`db` client to `logAuditEvent` so the throwing branch actually fires the rollback (silent fire-and-forget hides the recovery path).
- 2026-04-21 T-48: When two creation paths produce the same entity (e.g. Formation via /formations/creer vs deal closeAndCreateFormation), seeding-related side-effects (quests, sub-actions, default rows) MUST be replicated on both paths or extracted into a shared helper from day one — silent divergence between paths produces "ghost-empty" entities (e.g. Suivi tabs with zero quests) that look like UI bugs but are actually missing seed data.
- 2026-04-21 T-46: For "the data must come from a trusted source" invariants, a TypeScript brand type (`type Authenticated<X> = X & { readonly __brand: 'Authenticated' }` + a single mint helper) is more reliable than docstrings — the type system forces every caller to acknowledge the boundary at the call site, and refactors that introduce a new caller break the build instead of silently passing client input through. Pair with an RLS WITH CHECK clause (`user_id = auth.uid()`) for defense in depth so the SQL layer also rejects spoofed inserts even if Drizzle's RLS-bypass posture changes.

## Reviewed 2026-04-20

Reviewed 14 entries (T-9 → T-13). Most clusters were already absorbed in earlier rounds (transactional DB writes, RLS EXISTS chains, Storage path policies, Postmark templates-only, `transitionStatus` helpers, sub-action `orderIndex`, shared layout warnings, audit logging in transactions). Three new patterns warranted minimal agent updates: (1) **lifecycle pre-validation before `generateDocument`** to prevent orphaned Storage/DB rows (T-12) → added to `implementer.md` pitfalls; (2) **server-side preflight must run on EVERY generation entry point** — Documents action, Suivi quest, cron — not just the visible path (T-13) → added to `implementer.md`, `architect.md`, and as an edge-case bullet in `test-engineer.md`; (3) **Vercel Cron Jobs as the standard for scheduled SvelteKit work** with `CRON_SECRET` + service-role client (T-17) → added to `architect.md` pitfalls. Remaining entries (Svelte 5 `{#snippet}` reuse, French currency formatting, pdfmake CJS) are one-off insights already encoded in implementer.md or skill files.
