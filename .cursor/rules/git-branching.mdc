# Git Branching & Version Control

- **`main`**: Production only. Never commit directly to `main`.
- **`develop`**: Integration branch. All feature work merges here first.
- **Feature branches**: Always create from `develop`, format `type/short-description` (kebab-case):
  - `feat/`: New features
  - `fix/`: Bug fixes
  - `chore/`: Maintenance/config
  - `docs/`: Documentation
- **Conventional Commits**: Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc. in commit messages.
- **Short-lived branches**: Integrate to `develop` when the logical unit of work is done.
- **Fix/chore/docs**:
  - **New standalone task** (e.g. "fix login error", "update deps") → Create a new branch from `develop` (`fix/...`, `chore/...`, `docs/...`).
  - **Part of current work** (e.g. small fix while on `feat/forms`) → Commit on the current branch; use `fix:`, `chore:`, or `docs:` in the message.
- **Agent safety**: Never run `git push` or `git merge` unless the user explicitly said "Integrate", "Merge to develop", "Release", or "Ship to prod".

See [docs/git-workflow.md](../docs/git-workflow.md) for full details.
